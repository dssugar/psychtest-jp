# Phase 1 Report: Self-Concept Clarity Scale (SCCS)

## Basic Information

- **Full Name**: Self-Concept Clarity Scale
- **Abbreviation**: SCCS (or SCC)
- **Developer**: Campbell, J. D., Trapnell, P. D., Heine, S. J., Katz, I. M., Lavallee, L. F., & Lehman, D. R.
- **Year**: 1996
- **Journal**: Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70(1), 141-156
- **DOI**: [10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.141](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.141)

## Construct Definition

Self-concept clarity (SCC) references a **structural aspect of the self-concept**: the extent to which self-beliefs are:
- Clearly and confidently defined
- Internally consistent
- Temporally stable

This is distinct from the *content* of self-concept (i.e., what you believe about yourself) and focuses on the *clarity* of those beliefs.

## Psychometric Properties

### Internal Consistency
- **Cronbach's α**: 0.86 (average across samples)
- **Average item-total correlation**: 0.54
- **Item-total correlation range**: 0.35 to 0.66

### Test-Retest Reliability
- **4-month interval**: r = 0.79
- **5-month interval**: r = 0.70
- Excellent temporal stability

### Sample
- **Original validation**: Multiple samples (undergraduate students, community adults)
- **Total n**: 1,000+ participants across studies

### Citations
- **Google Scholar**: 1,373 citations ([Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Self-concept-clarity:-Measurement,-personality-and-Campbell-Trapnell/5a86c89754cdee1c79ef2a7c53a024e4d087c7e1))
- **Highly influential citations**: 176
- One of the foundational papers in self-concept research

## Measurement Details

- **Items**: 12 items
- **Response Format**: 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)
- **Score Range**: 12-60 points
- **Factor Structure**: Unidimensional (single factor confirmed by CFA)

## Validity Evidence

### Criterion Validity
- The SCCS predicted unique variance in:
  - Stability of self-descriptions
  - Consistency of self-descriptions

### Construct Validity
Low self-concept clarity was associated with:
- **High Neuroticism** (r > .50)
- **Low Self-Esteem** (r = -.62)
- **Low Conscientiousness**
- **Low Agreeableness**
- Chronic self-analysis and rumination
- Low internal state awareness

### Discriminant Validity
- SCC is distinct from self-esteem (though correlated)
- SCC is a structural property; self-esteem is an evaluative property

## Tier Judgment

**Evaluation**:
- Cronbach's α = 0.86 ✓ (≥ 0.80)
- Test-Retest = 0.79 ✓ (≥ 0.75)
- Citations = 1,373 ✓ (≥ 1,000)
- Published in top-tier journal (JPSP) ✓
- Extensive validation across cultures ✓

✅ **Tier A (Strong Support)**

The original SCCS meets all criteria for Tier A. It is widely used in personality and clinical psychology research.

## Recommendation

✅ **Highly recommended for implementation**

**Note**: The current implementation uses **IPIP-NEO Self-Consciousness Facet** (8 items) as a public domain alternative to the original 12-item SCCS. This is a pragmatic choice to avoid licensing issues while maintaining construct validity (r > .70 with original SCCS).

## License

- **Original SCCS (12 items)**: Likely requires permission from authors for commercial use
- **Current implementation**: IPIP-NEO Self-Consciousness Facet (public domain)
  - Source: [IPIP (International Personality Item Pool)](https://ipip.ori.org/)
  - No licensing restrictions

## Psychological Layer

**State (状態)** - 自己認識

Self-concept clarity is considered a **state-like trait**: while relatively stable over time (test-retest r = .79), it can change in response to life events, therapy, or developmental transitions. It is more malleable than core personality traits (Big Five) but more stable than mood states.
