# Phase 1 Report: K6 (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale)

## Basic Information

- **Full Name**: Kessler Psychological Distress Scale
- **Abbreviation**: K6
- **Developer**: Kessler, R. C., et al.
- **Year**: 2002
- **Journal**: Psychological Medicine, 32(6), 959-976
- **DOI**: 10.1017/S0033291702006074
- **Type**: Non-specific psychological distress screening scale

## Additional Key Publication

- **Clinical Validation**: Kessler, R. C., et al. (2003). Screening for serious mental illness in the general population. Archives of General Psychiatry, 60(2), 184-189.

## Psychometric Properties

### Original Study (Kessler et al., 2002)
- **Items**: 6 (short form embedded in K10)
- **Response Format**: 5-point Likert scale (0-4)
- **Timeframe**: Past 30 days
- **Cronbach's α**: 0.89
- **Test-Retest Reliability**: Good (stable over short intervals for 30-day recall period)
- **Sample Size**: Large-scale population survey (US National Health Interview Survey)
- **ROC Analysis**: AUC = 0.87-0.88 for DSM-IV disorders (GAF 0-70), AUC = 0.95-0.96 for severe disorders (GAF 0-50)

### Clinical Validation (Kessler et al., 2003)
- **Sensitivity**: 0.36 (at cutoff ≥ 13)
- **Specificity**: 0.96 (at cutoff ≥ 13)
- **Total Classification Accuracy**: 0.92 (at cutoff ≥ 13)
- **AUC**: 0.86 (for serious mental illness)

### International Validation
- Used in WHO World Mental Health Survey (global standard)
- Validated across multiple countries and languages
- Most commonly used screening measure in general population surveys
- Consistent psychometric properties across sociodemographic subsamples

## Tier Judgment

✅ **Tier A (Strong Support)**

### Criteria Met:
- ✅ Cronbach's α = 0.89 (≥ 0.80)
- ⚠️ Test-retest reliability: "Good" reported, but specific r-value not found in search (expected ≥ 0.75)
- ✅ Published in top-tier journals (Psychological Medicine, Archives of General Psychiatry)
- ✅ International standard (WHO survey adoption)
- ✅ Large-scale population validation
- ✅ Widely cited and used globally

### Rationale:
The K6 demonstrates excellent psychometric properties and is the most widely used brief screening tool for psychological distress globally. While it narrowly misses Tier S criteria due to lack of specific test-retest reliability coefficient in the literature search, its adoption by WHO and national health surveys worldwide confirms its exceptional quality. The scale's brevity (6 items), strong discrimination ability, and international validation make it ideal for population screening.

## Recommendation

✅ **Highly Recommended for Implementation**

### Strengths:
1. **Brevity**: Only 6 items (minimal respondent burden)
2. **International Standard**: Used in national health surveys worldwide
3. **Strong Discrimination**: Excellent ability to identify serious mental illness
4. **Public Domain**: No licensing fees for non-commercial use
5. **Cultural Validation**: Validated across diverse populations
6. **Non-specific**: Screens for general psychological distress (not limited to specific disorders)

### Use Cases:
- General population screening
- Primary care settings
- Research surveys
- Monitoring population mental health trends

## Psychological Layer

**State (状態)** - メンタルヘルス

### Category: Mental Health
- **Measures**: Current psychological distress (non-specific)
- **Framework Position**: State layer (temporary, changeable condition)
- **Complements**: PHQ-9 (depression-specific), GAD-7 (anxiety-specific)

### Unique Value:
Unlike disorder-specific screening tools (PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety), K6 captures general psychological distress that may indicate various mental health conditions. This makes it particularly valuable as a:
- First-line screening tool
- Population health indicator
- Complement to disorder-specific measures

## Scale Characteristics

### What K6 Measures:
Non-specific psychological distress over the past 30 days, including:
1. Nervousness
2. Hopelessness
3. Restlessness
4. Depression (feeling down that nothing could cheer you up)
5. Effort required for tasks
6. Worthlessness

### Scoring:
- **Range**: 0-24 points
- **Cutoffs** (commonly used):
  - 0-4: No distress
  - 5-9: Mild distress
  - 10-12: Moderate distress
  - 13-24: Severe distress / High probability of serious mental illness

### Clinical Cutoff:
**≥ 13 points** indicates high likelihood of serious mental illness and warrants professional evaluation.

## Implementation Notes

### For psychtest.jp:
1. **Tier A** status confirms scientific validity
2. **Public domain** status allows free implementation
3. **Japanese version** validation needed (Phase 2)
4. **Complements existing tests**: PHQ-9 (depression-specific) + K6 (general distress) provides comprehensive mental health screening
5. **National credibility**: Being used in Japan's National Livelihood Survey (国民生活基礎調査) adds legitimacy
